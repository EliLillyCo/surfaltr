	abstract = {Integrins have become key targets for molecular imaging and for selective delivery of anti-cancer agents. Here we review recent work concerning the targeted delivery of antisense and siRNA oligonucleotides via integrins. A variety of approaches have been used to link oligonucleotides to ligands capable of binding integrins with high specificity and affinity. This includes direct chemical conjugation, incorporating oligonucleotides into lipoplexes, and use of various polymeric nanocarriers including dendrimers. The ligand-oligonucleotide conjugate or complex associates selectively with the integrin, followed by internalization into endosomes and trafficking through subcellular compartments. Escape of antisense or siRNA from the endosome to the cytosol and nucleus may come about through endogenous trafficking mechanisms, or because of membrane disrupting capabilities built into the conjugate or complex. Thus a variety of useful strategies are available for using integrins to enhance the pharmacological efficacy of therapeutic oligonucleotides.},

The natural ligands of integrins are glycoproteins expressed on the cell surface or proteins of the extracellular matrix. For this reason, short peptides or peptidomimetic sequences that reproduce the integrin-binding motives have attracted much attention as potential drugs. When challenged in clinical trials, these peptides/peptidomimetics let to contrasting and disappointing results. In the search for alternative utilizations, the integrin peptide ligands have been conjugated onto nanoparticles, materials, or drugs and drug carrier systems, for specific recognition or delivery of drugs to cells overexpressing the targeted integrins. Recent research in peptidic integrin ligands is exploring new opportunities, in particular for the design of nanostructured, micro-fabricated, cell-responsive, stimuli-responsive, smart materials.},

	abstract = {Curing spinal cord injury (SCI) in mammals is a daunting task because of the lack of permissive mechanisms and strong inhibitory responses at and around the lesion. The neural cell adhesion molecule L1CAM (L1) has been shown to favor axonal regrowth and enhance neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity but delivery of full-length L1 or its extracellular domain could encounter difficulties in translation to therapy in humans. We have, therefore, identified several small organic compounds that bind to L1 and stimulate neuronal survival, neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth in an L1-dependent manner. Here, we assessed the functions of two L1 mimetics, trimebutine and honokiol, in regeneration following SCI in young adult mice. Using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) score, we found that ground locomotion in trimebutine-treated mice recovered better than honokiol-treated or vehicle-receiving mice. Enhanced hindlimb locomotor functions in the trimebutine group were observed at 6 weeks after SCI. Immunohistology of the spinal cords rostral and caudal to the lesion site showed reduced areas and intensities of glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity in both trimebutine and honokiol groups, whereas increased regrowth of axons was observed only in the trimebutine-treated group. Both L1- and L1 mimetic-mediated intracellular signaling cascades in the spinal cord lesion sites were activated by trimebutine and honokiol, with trimebutine being more effective than honokiol. These observations suggest that trimebutine and, to a lesser extent under the present experimental conditions, honokiol have a potential for therapy in regeneration of mammalian spinal cord injuries., Summary: Small molecule L1CAM mimetics, showing L1 functions by promoting neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival in vitro, are now shown in vivo, with correlated signal transduction, to promote recovery after injury.},

	abstract = {Efficient cellular delivery of biologically active molecules is one of the key factors that affect the discovery and development of novel drugs. The plasma membrane is the first barrier that prevents direct translocation of chemic entities, and thus obstructs their efficient intracellular delivery. Generally, hydrophilic small molecule drugs are poor permeability that reduce bioavailability and thus limit the clinic application. The cellular uptake of macromolecules and drug carriers is very inefficient without external assistance. Therefore, it is desirable to develop potent delivery systems for achieving effective intracellular delivery of chemic entities. Apart from of the types of delivery strategies, the composition of the cell membrane is critical for delivery efficiency due to the fact that cellular uptake is affected by the interaction between the chemical entity and the plasma membrane. In this review, we aimed to develop a profound understanding of the interactions between delivery systems and components of the plasma membrane. For the purpose, we attempt to present a broad overview of what delivery systems can be used to enhance the intracellular delivery of poorly permeable chemic entities, and how various delivery strategies are applied according to the components of plasma membrane.},

Here we introduce a strategy to define complete portfolios of full-length isoforms encoded by individual genes. Applying this approach to neural cell-surface molecules, we identify thousands of unannotated isoforms expressed in retina and brain. By mass spectrometry we confirm expression of newly-discovered proteins on the cell surface in vivo. Remarkably, we discover that the major isoform of a retinal degeneration gene, CRB1, was previously overlooked. This CRB1 isoform is the only one expressed by photoreceptors, the affected cells in CRB1 disease. Using mouse mutants, we identify a function for this isoform at photoreceptor-glial junctions and demonstrate that loss of this isoform accelerates photoreceptor death. Therefore, our isoform identification strategy enables discovery of new gene functions relevant to disease.},

We present a detailed analysis of TMHMM's performance, and show that it correctly predicts 97-98 \% of the transmembrane helices. Additionally, TMHMM can discriminate between soluble and membrane proteins with both specificity and sensitivity better than 99 \%, although the accuracy drops when signal peptides are present. This high degree of accuracy allowed us to predict reliably integral membrane proteins in a large collection of genomes. Based on these predictions, we estimate that 20-30 \% of all genes in most genomes encode membrane proteins, which is in agreement with previous estimates. We further discovered that proteins with N(in)-C(in) topologies are strongly preferred in all examined organisms, except Caenorhabditis elegans, where the large number of 7TM receptors increases the counts for N(out)-C(in) topologies. We discuss the possible relevance of this finding for our understanding of membrane protein assembly mechanisms. A TMHMM prediction service is available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/.},

Despite their utility and relevance, the unique combination of molecules present at the cell surface are not yet described for most cell types. A significant challenge in analyzing 'omic' discovery datasets is the selection of candidate markers that are most applicable for downstream applications.
RESULTS: Here, we developed GenieScore, a prioritization metric that integrates a consensus-based prediction of cell surface localization with user-input data to rank-order candidate cell-type-specific surface markers. In this report, we demonstrate the utility of GenieScore for analyzing human and rodent data from proteomic and transcriptomic experiments in the areas of cancer, stem cell and islet biology. We also demonstrate that permutations of GenieScore, termed IsoGenieScore and OmniGenieScore, can efficiently prioritize co-expressed and intracellular cell-type-specific markers, respectively.

	doi = {10.1016/j.jmb.2004.03.016},
	abstract = {An inherent problem in transmembrane protein topology prediction and signal peptide prediction is the high similarity between the hydrophobic regions of a transmembrane helix and that of a signal peptide, leading to cross-reaction between the two types of predictions. To improve predictions further, it is therefore important to make a predictor that aims to discriminate between the two classes. In addition, topology information can be gained when successfully predicting a signal peptide leading a transmembrane protein since it dictates that the N terminus of the mature protein must be on the non-cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Here, we present Phobius, a combined transmembrane protein topology and signal peptide predictor. The predictor is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the different sequence regions of a signal peptide and the different regions of a transmembrane protein in a series of interconnected states. Training was done on a newly assembled and curated dataset. Compared to TMHMM and SignalP, errors coming from cross-prediction between transmembrane segments and signal peptides were reduced substantially by Phobius. False classifications of signal peptides were reduced from 26.1\% to 3.9\% and false classifications of transmembrane helices were reduced from 19.0\% to 7.7\%. Phobius was applied to the proteomes of Homo sapiens and Escherichia coli. Here we also noted a drastic reduction of false classifications compared to TMHMM/SignalP, suggesting that Phobius is well suited for whole-genome annotation of signal peptides and transmembrane regions.
